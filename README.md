## [FRONTENDMENTOR.IO](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) CHALLENGES BY IOANNIS MENTESIDIS

Since is very important to have code on github, so you can find a job as a developer, i decided to take as many challenges as
i can from this awesome platform. I start with the easy stuff just to get familiar with all the processes. In the future of course i will give a try to the most advanced challenges.

### I like to use React.js and custom css
i focus on responsiveness of a site and recently i gave my best to upgrade my a11y knowledge.

### I work with:
1. classes
2. context api
3. media queries
4. flexbox
